# UFOs

## Background and Purpose
On this project, we assist datajournalist Dana on a story analyzing data of UFO sightings in Oregon, specifically her home town. Using java script we were able to post her story with her data for reference, and we were able to add filters on an html script to put the final article online and more accesible, comprehensable, and engaging, to the public at large who may read her piece.

## Results and Summary
This was the layout goal she had and we kept in mind when making the html component:

Ultimately, we crafted this page:

Here you can see the filters on the page meant to make the table (which is pretty sizable) more dynamic,reacting to user input. All you have to do is type in the white box entry field, and the html's table reacts. There are suggestions for the type of imput appropiate in the default empty cell, as seen below (e.g. the gray scale "1/10/2020" in the "Enter Date" text box. If a user puts in a value that is not appropiate for the imput field, like their own name when the site is asking for a shape, and tries to run the query, the table simply won'y produce an output. A drawback here may be that the user doesn't know what specifically to put outside of the gray scale suggestions when first approching the site. We could work with Dana to see if we should add a legend/key/word box of options.

I feel the website looks pretty incredible considering it's simple, and maybe it comes down to the organization, color-scheme and great quality of the header picture. I feel Dana should consider adding more analysis as some of her comments are vague and maybe without the reference of her article not that relevant to the average person (though something like "Car like object in the sky" needs no explaining, make of that what you will). I also think that it is already overwhelming even with only 7 features, but there are pros and cons to having the data on the screen from the start. Still were more features or data points to be added I feel we may need to expand to groupby system with buttons that bookmark to different sections of the data, having an overall comment from our journalist Dana for each.
