# UFOs

## Background and Purpose
On this project, we assist datajournalist Dana on a story analyzing data of UFO sightings in Oregon, specifically her home town. Using java script we were able to post her story with her data for reference, and we were able to add filters on an html script to put the final article online and more accesible, comprehensable, and engaging, to the public at large who may read her piece.

## Results
This was the layout goal she had and we kept in mind when making the html component:

Ultimately, we crafted this page:

Here you can see the filters on the page meant to make the table (which is pretty sizable) more dynamic,reacting to user input:
